As a Senior Manager of Corporate Strategy at Valo Health, I have the privilege of working across the organization on projects pertaining to strategy development, roadmap development, product discovery, financial planning, and corporate development. Valo is a technology company accelerating the creation of therapeutics through intelligent application of data science and machine learning. I first began working with Valo when the company has ~25 employees and have had the privilege of watching the company grow to >100 employees.

In my prior role as an associate at Innosight, I helped Fortune 500 companies identify, prioritize, and pursue growth opportunities during periods of rapid external change. Innosight, a growth strategy consultancy founded by Clay Christensen, seeks to drive meaningful insights by applying our unique lenses--disruptive innovation theory, jobs to be done, growth factory, and dual transformation--to client problems.

During my time at Innosight I gained experience across industries spanning high-tech, healthcare, and industrial settings. In addition, to client work, I have published several articles exploring aspects of corporate strategy (Harvard Business Review, IndustryWeek).

I graduated summa cum laude with a concentration in computational finance from Babson College. Expanding on my interest in commercializing technology, I authored a honors thesis exploring methods to stimulate space exploration with private investment.

In addition to my formal education, I have built substantial knowledge bases in data science, machine learning, and web development through remote learning programs and personal projects. I have participated in Lambda School's Data Science Immersive program, completed Coursera's AI in Medicine Concentration, and worked through Lambda School's web development curriculum. I believe continually learning and building technical depth allows me to be a more effective collaborator and communicator with product and technology teams.
