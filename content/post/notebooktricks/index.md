# Jupyter Notebook Tricks

`Command Mode` is when you are not actively editting the contents of a cell. When in command mode you can use the following shortcuts: 

`m` — convert cell to markdown

`y` — convert cell to code

`d` + `d` — delete the cell

`o` — toggle whether output is shown

`shift` + `arrow up/down` — select multiple cells

`shift` + `m` — merge cells

You can switch between `command mode` and `edit mode` with `esc` and `enter`

`?function-name` — shows the definition and docstring for that function
