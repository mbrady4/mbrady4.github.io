# Client- vs. Server-Side Routing

Client-side routing is a JavaScript managed routing option. It offers control over your site and URL and content without necessarily having to wait for a server to respond with content. It is designed to mimic the appearance of traditional multi-page websites. 

When Routing is handled internally by the JavaScript that is already on the page, we achieve what is known as Client-side routing. And this tool is how we get things done today, especially in React! And the best part about this is that the page won’t refresh! The data is just there, displayed when we ask for it. How this works is that when a user clicks on a requested resource, instead of the client asking for that resource from the server via a URL, JavaScript will prevent this. We then get the resource (state) that is already available to us rendered out, and when using react, this happens beautifully through component-based architecture.

*What is server-side routing? It’s the way the web has worked for decades.* Every link click & change of the address bar is a new request to a remote server. Every page load includes all page design elements, which must be re-downloaded. Including headers, navigation, sidebars, footers, etc. The server side routing method is not very efficient.

Routing is essential for handling communication between two computers. Routing is the way we navigate through websites and web applications today. When we click on a link on any web app or website, we are routing to a URL and requesting some information that lives somewhere else.
