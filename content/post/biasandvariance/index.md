Overall model error is a function of error due to bias plus error due to variance. The ideal model minimizes error from each.

- Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the actual target value. Models with high bias are under fit, low bias models may be overfit.
- Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value. Models with high variance may do well on test data but fail to generalize.
